  <h2 style="color:white"> Before Portland State Unviersity </h2> 
    <p style="font-family:verdana"> The Lincoln Hall building on the Portland State University campus has a storied history. Initially designed by Morris H. Whitehouse, it was constructed in 1912 to serve as the second home of Lincoln High School here in Portland. The land the building was built on was originally a cow pasture owned by Jacob Kamm, a man involved in the steamboat shipping trade on the nearby Columbia River. At one point, the building served 1580 students during its tenure as a part of Lincoln High School. However, the future of the building changed hands after the 1948 flood in Vanport City, where the Oregon State Board of Higher Education bought it from the public school district for $875,000 dollars. The original plan was for the Vanport Extension Center to move into the building following the sale, but the now necessary construction of the new Lincoln High School forced them to wait.

  <h2 style="color:white">  After Portland State University </h2> 
    <p style="font-family:verdana"> In 1955, the Vanport Extension Center became formally recognized as a college by a senate bill, and changed its name to Portland State College. Lincoln Hall had become part of the university since itâ€™s official inception. Even after the remodel of 1951-1952, repairs and revisions to the building were necessary in order to maintain the older building. All together, the building has had five official names over its lifespan, including Lincoln High School, Old Lincoln High School, Old Main, Portland State Extension Center, and Lincoln Hall. It now serves as the performing arts center on the Portland State University campus, with shows and classes rotating in and out.
